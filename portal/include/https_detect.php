//
// If you wish to set X-Cart to work through an HTTPS proxy, define the proxy
// IP address here and set the variable $HTTPS to 'true'. X-Cart will match all
// the IP addresses it will receive with incoming requests against the IP
// address specified here and thus will be able to define whether a request is
// coming from HTTPS proxy or not.
// If the web path used for work via HTTPS proxy differs from the path used for
// work via HTTP (for example, HTTP xcart web root: '/xcart/'; HTTPS xcart web
// root: '/~example/xcart/'), you also need to set the variable $HTTPS_RELAY to
// 'true'.
// Please find an example of processing such a situation below (In the example,
// the HTTPS proxy IP address is 192.160.1.1):
//
// if ($_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] == '192.160.1.1') {
//     $HTTPS_RELAY = true;
//     $HTTPS = true;
